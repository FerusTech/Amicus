Amicus
======

Amicus is a series of plugins for Sponge that are meant to introduce additional RPG aspects to the game.

## Amicus Core
Amicus Core is a Sponge plugin that controls storage and configuration for its extensions. Alone, it does nothing.

## Amicus Extensions
### Chat
Amicus Chat's purpose is to allow a more realistic RPG-type conversation platform.

Without configuration, Amicus Chat will have two channels:

 1. Default Channel
    * Shouting (Default, 50 block radius)
    * Talking (Default, 25 block radius)
    * Whispering (Default, 10 block radius)
 2. Global Channel

However, you can not only create your own channels, but you can configure the sh*t out of them.

#### Planned Features

 * Chat Logging
 * Templates
 * Complex Channel Configuration
    * GUI-based channel configuration
    * Sounds for incoming messages
    * Global/Universal/Distance
      * Distance (Shout/Talking/Whisper) Radii
 * Open PM by Clicking on User
 * Economy-based channels
 * Per-channel moderation (muting, kicking, banning, invites, reports, etc)
 * Per-channel permissions (Recommended [PermissionsEx](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/6198))
 * Channel Passwords
 * Discord Integration
 * Extremely Open API for Integrations
