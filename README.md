## Amicus Core
Amicus Core is a Sponge plugin that controls storage and configuration for its extensions. Alone, it does nothing.

## Chat
Amicus Chat's purpose is to allow a more realistic RPG-type conversation platform.

Without configuration, Amicus Chat will have two channels:

1. Default Channel
  * Shouting (Default, 50 block radius)
  * Talking (Default, 25 block radius)
  * Whispering (Default, 10 block radius)
2. Global Channel

However, you can not only create your own channels, but you can configure the sh*t out of them.

#### Planned Features

* Chat Logging
* Templates
* Complex Channel Configuration
  * GUI-based channel configuration
  * Sounds for incoming messages
  * Global/Universal/Distance
    * Distance (Shout/Talking/Whisper) Radii
* Open PM by Clicking on User
* Economy-based channels
* Per-channel moderation (muting, kicking, banning, invites, reports, etc)
* Per-channel permissions (Recommended [PermissionsEx](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/6198))
* Channel Passwords
* Discord Integration
* Extremely Open API for Integrations
